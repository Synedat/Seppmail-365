> Operational PowerShell assets for SEPPmail365 module usage in Microsoft 365 messaging environments.

This repository is maintained in a consistent public format by **Synedat Group GmbH** for the **SEPPmail ecosystem**. It is designed to be useful in discovery, implementation, operations, troubleshooting, architecture review and controlled handover scenarios.

## What this repository is for

The focus is **module lifecycle, connector creation, rollout sequencing, tenant readiness and evidence generation**.

It should help teams move from isolated commands or scripts to a more reviewable and reusable operating baseline.

## Intended audience

Messaging engineers, Exchange Online administrators, cloud platform teams and service providers.

## Repository highlights

- production-minded examples instead of bare placeholders
- stronger documentation depth for architecture, permissions and operations
- reusable guidance for evidence capture and change-safe execution
- consistent Synedat references and public discoverability across repositories
- compliance-aware wording for ISO/IEC 27001, BAIT, DORA, TISAX and adjacent governance themes

## Main building blocks

- SEPPmail365 PowerShell module
- Exchange Online tenant configuration
- Connector and rule orchestration
- Operational reporting and handover assets

## Quick start

1. Install the module and verify prerequisites.
2. Connect to Exchange Online and list the current transport landscape.
3. Create or validate connectors and transport rules in a controlled rollout window.

## Typical use cases

- Tenant onboarding for secure mail routing
- Connector and rule validation before a cutover
- Operational handover and runbook preparation
- Audit-oriented export of current messaging controls

## Permissions approach

- Exchange Administrator or equivalent delegated role
- Dedicated automation account for scripted runs
- Read-only reviewer role for evidence exports and peer review

## Functional extension ideas

- Add idempotent state export/import helpers
- Generate pre-change and post-change comparison reports
- Wrap repetitive tasks in CI-friendly non-interactive scripts

## Security and governance note

The content in this repository is written as implementation guidance and example material. It can support evidence-oriented work for information security and operational resilience, but it does not replace formal policy, legal interpretation, certification scope or vendor support statements.
